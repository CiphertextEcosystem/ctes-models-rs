# ctes_models for Rust

The CTES models present in this crate are generated from [CTES Protobuf](https://github.com/CiphertextEcosystem/CiphertextEcosystemProtobuf). The protobuf defines models that are generated across clients for many languages.

## Quickstart

You can build the generated structures using `make build`.
